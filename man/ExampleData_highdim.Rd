\format{
A list with the following components:
\describe{
\item{train}{A list containing:
\describe{
\item{z}{A data frame of dimension \eqn{n_{\mathrm{train}} \times 50}
containing covariates \code{Z1}–\code{Z50}.}
\item{status}{A numeric vector of event indicators
(\code{1}=event, \code{0}=censored).}
\item{time}{A numeric vector of observed survival times
\eqn{\min(T, C)}.}
\item{stratum}{A vector of stratum labels (here all equal to \code{1}).}

}
\item{test}{A list with the same structure as \code{train}, with
covariates of dimension \eqn{n_{\mathrm{test}} \times 50}.}
\item{beta_external}{A numeric vector of length 50 (named
\code{Z1}–\code{Z50}) containing Cox regression coefficients estimated
from an external dataset using only \code{Z1}–\code{Z6}, with zeros
for \code{Z7}–\code{Z50}.}
\item{beta_external.multi1}{External coefficient vector with additive
Gaussian noise applied to the nonzero entries of \code{beta_external},
preserving the original sparsity pattern.}
\item{beta_external.multi2}{External coefficient vector with weak
Gaussian noise applied to all 50 coefficients, yielding a dense but
low-magnitude perturbation.}
\item{beta_external.multi3}{A scaled version of \code{beta_external}
with uniformly attenuated signal strength.}
\item{beta_external.multi4}{External coefficient vector in which a
subset of the nonzero coefficients in \code{beta_external} have their
signs randomly flipped.}
\item{beta_external.multi5}{External coefficient vector with weakened
original signals and a small number of newly introduced weak signals
among previously zero coefficients.}

\description{
A simulated high-dimensional survival dataset under a linear Cox model
with 50 covariates (6 signals + 44 noise variables), a Weibull baseline
hazard, and controlled censoring. The dataset includes internal
train/test samples and multiple externally estimated coefficient vectors
representing different forms of coefficient perturbation.

\details{
Data-generating mechanism:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Covariates:} 50 covariates with true signals in
\code{Z1}–\code{Z6} and noise variables in \code{Z7}–\code{Z50}.
\itemize{
\item \code{Z1}, \code{Z2}: bivariate normal with AR(1) correlation
\eqn{\rho = 0.5}.
\item \code{Z3}, \code{Z4}: independent Bernoulli(0.5).
\item \code{Z5} \eqn{\sim N(2, 1)}, \code{Z6} \eqn{\sim N(-2, 1)}.
\item \code{Z7}–\code{Z50}: multivariate normal with AR(1)
correlation \eqn{\rho = 0.5}.
}
\item \strong{True coefficients:}
\eqn{\beta = (0.3, -0.3, 0.3, -0.3, 0.3, -0.3, 0, \ldots, 0)}.
\item \strong{Event times:} Weibull baseline hazard
\eqn{h_0(t) = \lambda \nu t^{\nu - 1}} with \eqn{\lambda = 1} and
\eqn{\nu = 2}. Given linear predictor \eqn{\eta = Z^\top \beta},
event times are generated as
\deqn{T = \left(\frac{-\log U}{\lambda e^{\eta}}\right)^{1/\nu},
    \quad U \sim \mathrm{Unif}(0,1).}
\item \strong{Censoring:} \eqn{C \sim \mathrm{Unif}(0, \mathrm{ub})},
where \code{ub} is tuned to achieve the target censoring rate
(internal: 0.70; external: 0.50). The observed time is
\eqn{\min(T, C)} with event indicator
\eqn{\mathbf{1}\{T \le C\}}.
\item \strong{External coefficients:} Cox regression models with
Breslow ties are fitted on the external dataset using
\code{Z1}–\code{Z6}. The resulting estimates are embedded into
length-50 coefficient vectors, with additional variants constructed
to represent different forms of coefficient perturbation and
distributional shift.
