# SurvBregDiv: Transfer Learning for Time-to-Event Modelling via Bregman Divergence

The **SurvBregDiv** package implements a Bregman-divergence-based
transfer learning framework for survival analysis, enabling principled
borrowing of external information while explicitly accommodating
population heterogeneity between the internal study and external
sources.

The package supports two primary study designs: full-cohort Cox
proportional hazards models and nested case–control (NCC) designs based
on conditional logistic regression on sampled risk sets.

### Key Features

**Three external data integration modes**  
Depending on the type of external data available, the package supports:

- **Individual-level data**: when full covariate and outcome data from
  an external cohort are accessible, integration is performed via a
  weighted pseudo-likelihood framework.
- **Coefficient-level summaries**: when only external regression
  coefficients $`\widetilde{\boldsymbol{\beta}}`$ are available,
  integration proceeds via Kullback–Leibler divergence penalization.
- **Coefficient + curvature summaries**: when an additional positive
  semidefinite matrix $`\mathbf{A}`$ (e.g., information matrix or
  variance–covariance matrix) is provided, integration proceeds via
  Mahalanobis distance penalization.

**Robustness to clustered and tied event times data**  
The package accounts for two structural features common in real-world
survival data. Between-cluster heterogeneity arising from multi-site
enrollment, matched designs, or hierarchical sampling is accommodated
via stratified partial likelihoods, which allow the baseline hazard to
vary freely across strata rather than imposing a common baseline. Tied
event times frequently occur when follow-up is recorded on a coarse time
scale such as daily records, scheduled clinical visits, or discretized
follow-up intervals, and are handled through tie-correction methods.

**High-dimensional variable selection** Penalized estimation with ridge,
lasso, and elastic net penalties is supported for variable selection and
shrinkage, with tuning parameters selected via cross-validation as
default. However, cross-validation optimizes predictive performance
rather than variable selection stability, and the selected predictor set
can vary considerably across repeated runs or minor perturbations of the
data. For settings where a reproducible and trustworthy shortlist of
predictors is needed, stability selection is also available, which
aggregates variable inclusion frequencies across subsamples to identify
predictors that are consistently selected regardless of which subjects
happen to be in the training set.

**Ensemble integration via bagged estimation**  
Besides cross-validated LASSO and stability selection, the package
supports an ensemble strategy that combines bootstrapping, external-data
integration, and model aggregation—conceptually similar to bootstrap
aggregation (bagging). This bagged integration approach reduces variance
and improves predictive robustness compared to relying solely on a
single cross-validated integrated LASSO model.

**Flexible cross-validation criteria**  
Model tuning supports a broad range of cross-validation criteria.
Discrimination- based measures include Harrell’s concordance index
(C-index) \[@harrell1982evaluating\], and partial likelihood–based
criteria include the Verweij & Van Houwelingen (V&VH) loss and the
cross-validated linear predictor loss. For full details on each
criterion, see **Appendix: CV Criteria**.

**Pathwise solution for integration weights**  
To select the integration weight $`\eta`$ that governs the strength of
external borrowing, the package provides two complementary tuning
strategies: (i) a grid search approach based on a pre-specified sequence
of candidate values, and (ii) an adaptive tuning strategy using Bayesian
optimization to directly explore the integration weight space, which is
particularly efficient when evaluating each candidate is computationally
expensive.
