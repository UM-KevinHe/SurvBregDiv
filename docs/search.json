However, datasets often exhibit limited effective sample sizes, high dimensionality, low signal--noise ratios, additional practical constraints including privacy considerations restricted data access. Integrating external information offers principled strategy improving model efficiency. Yet, classical data-integration methods typically rely assumption multiple datasets arise common data-generating mechanism. modern biomedical applications, assumption rarely satisfied. Misspecification due population heterogeneity can induce substantial bias, motivating development transfer-learning approaches explicitly accommodate -source discrepancies. Bregman divergence successfully applied borrowing information binary-outcome settings, extending ideas censored time--event outcomes nontrivial due right censoring limited nature available external survival information (e.g., predicted risk scores, fitted regression coefficients, hazard ratios without access baseline hazard). Beyond full-cohort survival studies, many biomedical investigations rely nested case–control (NCC) design alleviate burden labor-intensive measurements, high-cost data acquisition, destructive finite biospecimen assays. NCC design, small number matched controls sampled failure time, producing survival data analyzed conditional logistic regression applied matched risk sets. Despite practical relevance, existing methodology software supports transfer learning external information borrowing NCC designs.
